- In JavaScript, almost all I/O is non-blocking.
  - The run-time fires off your request and moves on
  - If we need the result, we can pass a callback function to the non-blocking funciton
- JavaScript runtime contains a message queue
  - Things are put onto the queue
  - The event loop repeatedly runs through the queue
- Issues with scope
- Run to completion before the tackling the next thing in the queue
- Two common patterns for receiving events asynchronously
  - events
  - callbacks
